                    <p>From a certain point of view, every one of us are screenplay writers. Really bad ones. When we write the screenplay for our life it’s often simple, concise, and if made into a major motion picture it would be … boring. Film screenplays will challenge our heroes, forcing them through a crucible from which they’ll emerge all the better...or all the worse. Either way, it makes for a good story. When writing our own screenplays, we rarely choose to include these elements. I mean, who wants to watch our father figure sacrifice himself at the hands of the Emperor's henchman? The good news is, despite how best we plan out our lives, life will toss things into disarray for us.</p>

                    <p>Another analogy for life (and one that is probably more appropriate for this audience) is a Git repository - there are branches that send our lives off the beaten path. Maybe we want to try a new hobby, move to a new city, or something tragically unexpected crops up like a heart attack. Regardless, our life will move off into different directions, and at some point we’ll need to reconcile, or ‘merge,’ our initial plan with these new directions.</p>

                    <p>My life is a lot like that. At the time of this writing I’m a 29 year old Environmental Health and Safety Professional. I have as many years in college as a medical doctor, a graduate degree, plus 5 years of professional level experience. Yet, I’ve decided to branch off from the plan I created years ago and drive my professional life into a new direction: web development.</p>

                    <p>I’m sure some of you are like me: aspiring web developers or software engineers who are seeking to make a career change from something totally different. I’m sure you can already relate to my story. Others are probably (hopefully) potential employers wanting to know if I’m worth the risk (answer: yes). You may be wondering why, after all of this time, money, and education, change now? “Did you fail?” Nope, as a matter of fact I was sought out for promotion to a site safety manager position at Amazon.com even before my one year anniversary. “Do you hate your job?” No,. while there are certainly aspects of my job I’m not fond of, the challenges of occupational safety have helped me develop skills I’ll need in any socially challenging environment.</p>

                    <hr class="primary">

                    <p>“So...why?” Let’s rewind a few years. Okay, let’s go back a few more. One more. Aaannd, stop! Here we find eleven year old me playing Counter-Strike on my uncles linux box that was also doubling as a server at LAN War in Louisville, Kentucky. This was the first time I was exposed to PC gaming and the world of computing (I played DOOM once on my dad’s workstation before my mom saw what it was). Since that time I have built my own computers, learned to make custom maps in the Unreal game engine, made some cool models in 3ds Max, and even build a 10+ hour single player campaign for Arma II downloaded by thousands of players. Despite all of this, I never considered programming until just a few months ago. Like many of you, I believed programming involved copious amounts of math, a topic in which I never really cared much for, despite getting B's (and some C's… okay, maybe more than “some”) in school, and quite frankly I didn’t think I had the aptitude for it. I’ve always had the urge to create and express myself with art and writing. Programming is something that only the “left brained” folks can understand.</p>

                    <p>Let’s fast forward a few years to May, 2017. Here I am taking on online course in C++. Just the day prior, I had spent the whole day playing Stellaris, a strategy game much like the Civilization series. Despite winning the game (no one ever really wins, but you’d only know that if you’ve played the game…just one more turn....) I found myself looking back on the weekend and feeling like I had wasted it. While I often enjoy the occasional care-free weekend, I had begun to have a lot of those. I wanted to do something. So, I figured I’ll do something new but also something challenging. YOLO, right? (Oh my gosh, I’m so sorry. If you’re a prospective employer, please don’t judge me!)</p>

                    <p>C++ was a bad idea. The course I took went from 0 to 100 real quick, and while I understood enough to pass the quizzes, I didn’t really understand what I was doing, or more importantly, how to apply it. Plus, I didn’t really know what I wanted to learn programming for. After a few weeks, I took a step back and found some good online resources on where to begin. I found the book Automate the Boring Stuff Using Python, which was perfect (and I highly recommend!). Not only could I learn some simple programming techniques, I could apply them to the more mundane tasks at work (of which we have a lot of in safety, from parsing data for trend analysis to creating forms).</p>

                    <p>From there, I quickly discovered programming was not this impossible skill that only the world’s most cognitively gifted could ascertain. It also helps that after having worked through real world problems, studying relational databases is much more exciting to me now than if I had to learn this in high school. Months went by and I couldn’t get enough. Idle 3.6 took over Steam’s spot on my Window’s task bar, my youtube front page was covered in programming tutorials and software development channels. I couldn’t wait to get home from work and plug right back into the Matrix.</p>                 

                    </br>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">We have to go back! ... Back...to the question!</h2>

                    <hr class="primary">

                    <p>It wasn’t long until I discovered “coding bootcamps.” This changed everything for me. I had been quietly agonizing over not getting a CS degree, but the more I read into a CS career the more I learned that didn’t really matter. The beauty of software development is that you can physically demonstrate your value to a prospective employer. I can’t show anybody how good at being a safety specialist I am, I can only speak to my job experience and ask others to give me a recommendation. Right now, you can log onto my Github page and review the quality of my work. That is what makes a coding bootcamp successful - while you don’t get a degree, you do get the skills you’ll need to get an entry level job.</p>

                    <p>Now, I didn’t have the money to both quit my job and shell out for a bootcamp, but that’s only one option. This is the internet. You can learn everything you need to know, as well as some altruistic souls willing to help you along the way because many of them have been there, too (not everyone out there is a troll). Online bootcamps can also provide you a guided path with mentors to guide you for the fraction of the cost while allowing you to work at your own pace. At the time of this writing, I have take many of Udacity’s free online into courses and have just completed the first section of their Full-Stack Nano-Degree.</p>

                    <p>So, back to the question: “Why?” Because I love having the power to create. I love challenging myself. I love that programming has taught me that the only limits to my life are those I’ve imposed on myself. I’ve created an experimental branch on the my life’s repository, and it’s only a matter of time before I merge it all together.</p>
